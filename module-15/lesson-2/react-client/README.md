Sure, here's a step-by-step guide on how to consume data using Socket.IO in a React application:

1. First, install the socket.io-client package in your React application. This package allows your React application to connect to a Socket.IO server. You can install it using npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install socket.io-client
```

2. Let's import the client
```typescript
import io from 'socket.io-client';
```


run flask app
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  
```
```bash

```
